# TeffilasHaderech
A Open Source Teffilas Haderech App

## About

This repository contains the source code for my open source Teffilas Haderech android application.

This application was created due to the poor quality of the old and unmaintained Teffilas Haderech apps on the google play store.

I decided to take my own approach and build a modern Teffilas Haderech app with Hebrew, English, and Transliterated options, as well as a nice and clean user interface.

### Downloading

You can download this app from the google play store. [Teffilas Haderech](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wyre.teffilashaderech)

### Architecture

The app uses a simple Architecture where each screen is represented by a Fragment Wrapped by a Activity.
